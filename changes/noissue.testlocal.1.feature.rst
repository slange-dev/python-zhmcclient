Test: Added test modules 'test__import_local.py' to the unit and end2end
tests which verify that the 'zhmcclient' modules are imported from the local
directory. Documented in chapter "Testing" that the zhmcclient modules are
imported from the local directory, even when the zhmcclient package is
installed in the Python environment.
